# IntentSwap AI – Predictive Cross-Chain Token Swap Optimizer

IntentSwap AI is an innovative solution designed for the [Zcash x Near Hackathon](https://taikai.network/hackbox/hackathons/zcashxnear/overview). It enables users to set swap intents—specifying token amounts and conditions—and leverages AI predictions to execute cross-chain swaps at the optimal time and through the most cost-effective path.

## Overview

- **User Intents:** Users specify swap details (e.g., “Swap 10 ETH for 1000 ZEC”) and authorize the system to execute when conditions are favorable.
- **AI Forecast & Optimizer:** Our AI engine monitors market conditions (prices, gas fees, liquidity) and predicts the best execution time and route.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Integrates with bridging protocols (Wormhole, Rainbow Bridge, etc.) to enable multi-step swaps.
- **Zcash Privacy Integration:** Offers optional privacy by routing certain transactions through Zcash shielded addresses.

## Architecture Overview

The project is divided into several key components:
- **Front-End:** A DApp (built with React/Next.js) where users create and manage swap intents.
- **Intent Creation & Storage:** Users sign and store intents on NEAR-based smart contracts.
- **AI Engine:** Gathers market data, predicts price movements, and optimizes swap routes.
- **Execution Layer:** Handles on-chain transactions and cross-chain bridging with integrated privacy options.

## Tech Stack

- **Front-End:** React/Next.js, wallet connectors (NEAR Wallet, MetaMask, Phantom)
- **Smart Contracts:** NEAR for intent storage and execution
- **Backend/AI:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) for AI predictions and route optimization
- **Bridging:** Integration with cross-chain bridging protocols like Wormhole and Rainbow Bridge
- **Data Feeds:** On-chain oracles (Chainlink, Pyth) and API data (CoinGecko)

## Demo

Include screenshots or a short video preview here (if available).

## Roadmap

- MVP focusing on basic AI forecasting and a single bridging route.
- Expand AI model to support more advanced prediction techniques.
- Integrate additional cross-chain bridging protocols and privacy enhancements.
