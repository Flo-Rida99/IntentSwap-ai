# 🚀 IntentSwap AI – Predictive Cross-Chain Token Swap Optimizer 🤖

IntentSwap AI is an innovative solution designed for the [Zcash x Near Hackathon](https://taikai.network/hackbox/hackathons/zcashxnear/overview). It enables users to specify swap intents—authorizing the system to execute cross-chain swaps when market conditions are optimal—all without a dedicated user interface.

## 📌 Overview

- **User Intents:** Users define swap parameters (e.g., “Swap 10 ETH for 1000 ZEC”) via signed transactions. These intents include conditions like maximum slippage or fee limits. ✍️
- **AI Forecast & Optimizer:** Our AI engine monitors market conditions (prices, gas fees, liquidity) and predicts the optimal execution time and route. 📈🤖
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Integrates with bridging protocols (Wormhole, Rainbow Bridge, etc.) to enable multi-step swaps. 🔗🌐
- **Zcash Privacy Integration:** Offers optional privacy by routing parts of transactions through Zcash shielded addresses. 🔒

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

The project is divided into several key backend components:
- **Intent Creation & Storage:** Users sign transactions that specify the swap parameters; these intents are stored on-chain using NEAR smart contracts. 📜💾
- **AI Engine:** Gathers market data, predicts short-term price movements, and optimizes swap routes using graph-based algorithms. 📊🤖
- **Execution Layer:** Handles on-chain transactions and cross-chain bridging to perform the swap when optimal conditions are met. ⚙️🚀

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts:** NEAR for intent storage and execution. ⛓️
- **Backend/AI:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) for AI predictions and route optimization. 🐍🤖
- **Bridging:** Integration with cross-chain bridging protocols like Wormhole and Rainbow Bridge. 🌉🔗
- **Data Feeds:** On-chain oracles (Chainlink, Pyth) and API data (CoinGecko). 📡

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- MVP focusing on basic AI forecasting and a single bridging route. 🚀
- Expand the AI model to support more advanced prediction techniques. 🧠
- Integrate additional cross-chain bridging protocols and privacy enhancements. 🔒🌐
